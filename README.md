# gitbiz

creating a React-based interface to present data from a GitHub API in an interactive and engaging way. What you display and how you display it is entirely up to you, but your app must allow users to interact with your data visualisation in some way.

The basic idea is that a digital coding-centred business card is created from public information on your GitHub profile.

#Tasks

- [ ] Draw out your interface
- [ ] Choose which pieces of the interface can be separated into components
- [ ] Draw out the tree structure for your components
- [ ] Decide which pieces of state each component will need and get a rough idea of where this state will sit on your tree
- [ ] Design your state so you keep it to a minimum. Don't repeat yourself!
- [ ] Ensure state is high enough it can be shared by necessary components, but as low as possible to avoid passing it unnecessarily.
